# spam_mail_predictor
A machine learning project that predicts whether an email is spam or not using NLP techniques and classification algorithms in Python.

**🚀 Features**
Detects spam emails with high accuracy.
Uses text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
Implements multiple ML algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).
Easy to train and test on custom datasets.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
Python
Scikit-learn
NLTK / spaCy (for NLP preprocessing)
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

**📂 Project Workflow**
Data Collection – Dataset of spam & ham emails.
Text Preprocessing – Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
Model Training – Train ML models like Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression.
Evaluation – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.
Prediction – Test on real-world emails.

**⚡ How to Run**
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/chetassiddhu/spam_mail_predictor.git
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the predictor script:
python spam_predictor.py

**📈 Future Improvements**
Deep learning model for higher accuracy.
Integration with Gmail/Outlook API.
Deploy as a web app for live spam detection.
